        He was once pushed by an unknown force, dizzied and lost in the summer
        of Kanagawa. The one he cherished always remained just out of reach, his
        first love naive and unexpected, like a ripe pomegranate that tastes
        surprisingly bitter upon the first bite.

        Before him, an eternal sea always sprawled, its calm waves silently
        engulfing the soul he deemed inconsequential. He stood, for what felt
        like eternity, at the fringe of a solitary island, until a hand reached
        out, pulling him away from his perpetual wander.

        |<br /><br />This summer was painted in strokes too vivid and bold, I
        wish it never fades. I'm well aware that no one can hold onto passion
        with unwavering focus forever; summer always leaves, and it has already
        gone. Yet, summer will return, with its warm winds and waves visiting on
        schedule every year, so the story never really ends. In countless
        worlds, we sketch, and watch a chapter of their lives unfold. Even after
        both the authors and readers have left their seats, in unseen corners,
        their endless tales continue. <br /><br />Between August and October, I
        found myself gazing at the sea several times, having not visited the
        shoreline in perhaps four or five years before that—the same sea bore
        witness to the end of one chapter of my life and the beginning of
        another. Listening to the endless waves and sea breezes of the American
        West Coast, their stories swiftly danced through my mind.
